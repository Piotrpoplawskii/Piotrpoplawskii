Hi my name is Piotr Poplawski and I am currently taking this course to see if I truly have any intrest in coding or rather if I like the idea of it. Im stuck between cybersecurity or computer science but heavily leaning on cybersecurity. I was previously in the medical field but I quickly figured out that wasn't for me so I am giving the IT field a try.
