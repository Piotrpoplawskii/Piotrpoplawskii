Hi, my name is Piotr Poplawski and I am currently taking this course to see if I truly have any interest in coding or rather if I like the idea of it. I'm stuck between cybersecurity and computer science but heavily leaning on cybersecurity. I was previously in the medical field but I quickly figured out that wasn't for me so I am giving the IT field a try. I'm still not 100% sure if the Technology field is still for me but once again taking a class like this can help me figure out whether or not I enjoy coding and if I like it perhaps I will pursue a software development job. Along with that I do believe this class is one of my graduation requirements so that's another reason I am taking it but overall I am very glad to take a class that can help me reach a dream job.
